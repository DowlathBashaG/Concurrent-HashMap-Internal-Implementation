# Concurrent-HashMap-Internal-Implementation

Concurrent HashMap internal implementation in java? Explain here.

		✅ What it is
		✅ How it's structured internally
		✅ Key concepts (segments vs. bins, locks)
		✅ How get, put, and compute work
		✅ Changes since Java 8

🔍 What is ConcurrentHashMap?

		ConcurrentHashMap<K, V> is a thread-safe, high-performance implementation of the Map interface used in concurrent environments.
		It allows concurrent reads and synchronized writes without locking the entire map.

📦 Internal Structure (Java 8+)

		ConcurrentHashMap
		└── Table (Node<K, V>[])
			├── Each Node holds key, value, hash, and next
			└── Can be a:
				 • Linked list (if few keys per bin)
				 • Tree (TreeNode, if many keys hash to same bin)
		In Java 8+, it uses:

		A single array: Node<K, V>[] table

		Locking is done per bucket/bin, not per entire map

		🧱 Key Components

		Component	Purpose
		
		Node<K, V>	Stores key, value, hash, and next pointer
		table[]	Main hash table array
		synchronized blocks	Used only when writing
		CAS (Compare-And-Swap)	Used for thread-safe operations
		TreeNode	Used if too many collisions (like HashMap treeification)

		⚙️ How Operations Work

		✅ get(key)
		Calculates hash(key)

		Locates index via index = (n - 1) & hash

		Reads the node without any locking (fully concurrent)

		If tree node exists → searches in red-black tree

		✅ put(key, value)
		Calculates hash and bin index.

		If bin is empty → uses CAS to insert node (no lock needed).

		If bin is not empty:

		Synchronizes only on that bin (synchronized block).

		Traverses list or tree and updates/inserts.

		If bin is too long (≥ 8), converts to TreeNode (Red-Black Tree).

		🔒 Only locks the individual bin, not the whole table — making it highly concurrent.

		✅ compute, computeIfAbsent, etc.
		Uses CAS loops and fine-grained synchronization to safely update nodes

		Very efficient in concurrent environments

🆚 Comparison with Other Maps

		Feature	HashMap	Hashtable	ConcurrentHashMap
		Thread-safe	❌	✅ (fully locked)	✅ (fine-grained locking)
		Null keys/values	✅	❌	❌
		Performance	⚡ Fast (single-thread)	🐢 Slow (all methods synchronized)	⚡⚡ High-performance concurrency
		🧠 Summary
		Java 8+ ConcurrentHashMap uses a single array with synchronized bins (no segment).

		Reads are lock-free.

		Writes use fine-grained locking.

		Uses CAS + synchronized + treeification.

		Ideal for multi-threaded apps.
